Ben never realized he had magical ability until after the surgery. The doctors who performed the surgery did not tell him either — they just wanted to get paid and keep a relationship with the smuggling world.</p><p>Frustrated and disenchanted with the smugglers and doctors, Ben turned to learning about his magical abilities. As he grew in spellcasting and channeling adept powers he worked to combine these with his passion and skill for vehicles and drones.</p><p>Ben makes a good living by doing odd jobs, from simple mechanic work to the occasional driver. He maintains a good relationship with his former mentor, though it was not without its problems. Some of Ben’s mentor’s loyalty comes from a sense of responsibility for the street doc fiasco, even as Ben has turned it into an asset.</p>"}]}
