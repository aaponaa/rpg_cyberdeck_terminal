Ben never realized he had magical ability until after the surgery. The doctors who performed the surgery did not tell him either — they just wanted to get paid and keep a relationship with the smuggling world.</p><p>Frustrated and disenchanted with the smugglers and doctors, Ben turned to learning about his magical abilities.

He maintains a good relationship with his former mentor, though it was not without its problems. Some of Ben’s mentor’s loyalty comes from a sense of responsibility for the street doc fiasco, even as Ben has turned it into an asset.</p>"}]}
